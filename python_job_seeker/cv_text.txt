Arbitrage Bot Project: Developed an algorithm for detecting changes in DEXs liquidity pools in token pairs in Solana Blockchain using the following integration APIs: Orca SDK, Meteora API, Raydium API. The algorithm fetched data from these DEXs and calculated the swap fees between two different liquidity pools for possible profit opportunities. Tested with Hardhat framework.
DAO Scrypt Platform for voting: Designed and Implemented architecture for DAO application for voting through crypto BSV with Handcash wallet. The application used scrypt to interact with the smart contracts to store the votes of statements with 60% or more votes to reach consensus. Once consensus was reached, the participants were rewarded with BSV depending on the level of participation. The Dapp had React in the front-end and Node.js in the back-end. 
MemeCoin Platform Project: Maintained an already deployed platform to buy, sell and swap a specific memecoin ERC20 token-based. Fixed bugs related with the integration of metamask wallet and Chakra-UI components. Added new endpoints in a nodejs server using axios that fetched data from Metamask and interacted through ethers.js. Tested and deployed new smart contracts that interacted with ERC20 tokens in testnets such as Sepolia-Infura and Gitcoin fake Ether. 
Open Sea NFT project: Integrated React App that was already minting NFTs ERC721 in OpenSea with IPFS Piñata Framework to be able to have their own references for their digital assets. Therefore we developed an inside platform that fetched the NFTs created through the App and also accessible in OpenSea with more information and features for selling and buying these assets created in the platform. Managed MongoDB local database that fetched info from the blockchain with a cron job. Tested with truffle in Ropstein-Infura. Local testing in Ganache-cli
Decentralized Social Media project: Maintained and fixed bugs of a ERC20 based platform that was minting usernames so they can interact with other users through posts and comments, executing microtransactions with each action. Implemented features of Alchemy SDK for testing networks such as Sepolia, and front-end components for metamask integration. Tested Open Zeppelin protocols with the creation of new smart contracts that will interact with the ones already deployed to detect security breaches. Therefore auditing solidity smart contracts.  
Real Estate NFT project: Developed a simple ERC721 smart contract to distribute the NFT of a real estate property between different owners, therefore also distributing the rent by the percentage of ownership. Integrated through web3.js the backend endpoints with the smart contract ABI methods. Audited and deployed the solidity smart contracts and tested it in the Ropstein-Infura network. 
TRON ERC20 token auditing: Audited with reports of the possible vulnerabilities of a smart contract forked from ERC20 TRON token which had some additional methods. Used Open Zeppelin protocols to have a reference over the possible vulnerabilities. Developed other smart contracts that would interact with the first ones to ensure they cannot break the system.
